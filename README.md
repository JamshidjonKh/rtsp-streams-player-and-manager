```sh
npm i
```
make sure you have [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) installed on your computer and available in your %path% enviorement variable.
for instance, in windows:
```sh
C:\ffmpeg\bin
```
so the command ffmpeg in the cmd works.
in windows, you may have to run the server in administrator mode.

Run the server(port: 5000) and client(port: 3000)

```sh
npm run dev
```
